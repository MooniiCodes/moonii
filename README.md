# Moonii

Moonii is a all-fun-and-games-software (AFAGS) for kids to play on. It is heavily moderated and *soon* will have a rulebook of every rule you need to know.

Moonii is safe by having no chatting, no free-form creation. Only leaderboards are allowed for cloud variables.

# Why I made Moonii

I loved Roblox, it was amazing for me. Until *shleep* got banned. Then this p**o stuff. I was sick of it.

So I created Moonii to fix Roblox's mistakes, to revive, remember, and love Roblox for what it used to be.

# To developers

Currently I am working on documents for Moonii and am planning on making a very detailed guide.

# Note

Please do not ask me for new updates or admin. Only tell me if there is a bug in the issues tab.
